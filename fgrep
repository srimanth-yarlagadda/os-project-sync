Calc type is quadratic, first arg is -7, second arg is 12
first
(1, -7, 12) solutions = 4.000000, 3.000000

Calc type is triples, first arg is 10, second arg is 20
second
-- 3, 4, sqrt = 5
-- 5, 12, sqrt = 13
-- 8, 15, sqrt = 17

Calc type is mod-sum, first arg is 100, second arg is 1000
third
sum from 1 to 100 is 50

The End!
